# Code Samples

The following are code samples showcasing work in Node.js, React, and React Native.

## event.router.js

This Express router was written for a chore management system. It allows users to create new persistant instances of complete chores (called events) and challenge existing chores. Users can also upload images to the API to for before and after picture verification.

## game.model.js

This Sequelize model was also written for the same chore management system. It exposes methods to create, read, update, and destroy household instances (called games) in a PostgreSQL database.

## AnimatedRow.js

This React Native component renders an animated row in a FlatList. When the user taps on the row, the content slides to the right exposing options buttons to the left. One potential use case for this component would be enabling users to easily edit or delete content in a FlatList.
